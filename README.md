# `create-vortex-extension`

> A lightweight(ish) CLI for scaffolding new Vortex extensions

## Installation

You don't actually need to, realistically. Just run `npm init vortex-extension` and `npm` will do the hard work of downloading and running the CLI.

If you really want to install it, just run `npm i -g create-vortex-extension` then run `create-vortex-extension` to get started.

## Options

The scaffolding process is interactive and will prompt you for some required information. To cut down on questions, you can also run `create-vortex-extension --defaults` to use reasonable defaults for most choices (this is still interactive though!). You can also pass `--install` to immediately install all the required dependencies (only applies to some templates).
